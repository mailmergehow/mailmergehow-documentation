### Attachment issues: <a href="#h.e0w4cxplbpwm_l" id="h.e0w4cxplbpwm_l"></a>

Here are the most common errors encountered with attachments:

**1- Message "Attachment Error, Limit Exceeded: Email Total Attachments Size should not exceed 5Mb":**

There is a limit on the size you are allowed to send with Gmail (It's a limitation decided by Google), we can't do anything about that.
